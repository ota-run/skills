# Contract Patterns

Use these canonical snippets when the repo truth supports the stronger Ota surface.

## Compose image hydration

Use the dedicated container-image network effect when Ota owns a finite Compose image-pull lane.
This is registry acquisition, not package dependency hydration; immutable image receipt evidence is
a separate runtime-identity claim.

```yaml
tasks:
  setup:images:
    prepare:
      kind: dependency_hydration
      medium: container_images
      source:
        kind: docker_compose
        cwd: docker
        files: [compose.yaml]
      targets: [database]
    requirements:
      tools:
        docker: "*"
    effects:
      network: true
      network_kind: container_image_hydration
      external_state: [docker]
```

## Task platform support

Use `tasks.<name>.only_on` when a task body itself is supported only on specific hosts. This is
different from `variants.<i>.when.os`, which chooses an alternate body on a host that the task
supports, and from `execution.contexts.<name>.only_on`, which scopes one execution environment.

```yaml
tasks:
  verify:native:
    only_on: [linux, macos]
    command:
      exe: bin/verify
```

Ota refuses the selected task closure before provisioning when a dependency is unsupported on the
current host. Keep a container branch or context separate when the task remains portable through
that execution plane.

## Interactive finite command

Use `command.interaction` when terminal capability is part of the real task boundary. The default
`auto` permits a human native TTY when available. Use `forbidden` for deterministic captured
verification, and `required` when the command cannot proceed without a terminal. Agent, container,
remote, and ordinary non-TTY CI execution do not receive this capability.
For `required`, terminal passthrough takes precedence over `--stream`; Ota does not claim captured
task output for that invocation.

```yaml
tasks:
  cloudflare:login:
    description: Authenticate a human operator through Wrangler OAuth
    command:
      exe: wrangler
      args: [login]
      interaction: required
    safe_for_agent: false
```

Do not apply this to `launch.kind: command`, shell `run`, or `script` bodies. Those surfaces do
not use the finite-command terminal-capability path. Do not use `auto` to compensate for a task
that should be fully non-interactive in CI; declare credentials and a non-interactive command
instead.

## Service launch

Use `launch.kind: command` for long-running service processes instead of hiding service startup
behind opaque `run`.

```yaml
tasks:
  dev:
    description: Start the Rails API server
    launch:
      kind: command
      exe: bundle
      args:
        - exec
        - rails
        - server
      runtime_projection:
        listener: api
        adapter: rails
    runtime:
      kind: service
      listeners:
        api:
          protocol: http
          bind:
            address: 0.0.0.0
            port:
              mode: fixed
              value: 3000
          project:
            host:
              address: 127.0.0.1
              port:
                mode: fixed
                value: 3000
              path: /
              primary: true
      surfaces: [api]

Use `launch.runtime_projection` only when the adapter is explicitly supported and the bind truth
already lives under explicit `runtime.listeners`.
```

## Interactive workflow attach

When the truthful developer path starts in the background and then re-attaches to an existing
interactive session, declare that session as a first-class workflow attach lane instead of hiding
it in shell glue.

```yaml
tasks:
  devenv:attach:
    requirements:
      tools:
        docker: "*"
    compose:
      kind: attach
      service: main
      exe: tmux
      args:
        - attach
        - -t
        - penpot

workflows:
  default: devenv
  devenv:
    run:
      task: devenv:start
    attach:
      task: devenv:attach
```

## Aggregate verification

Use `aggregate.tasks` for bounded parent verification tasks instead of fake `run: "true"` bodies.

```yaml
tasks:
  verify:
    description: Run the full verification slice
    aggregate:
      tasks:
        - lint
        - typecheck
        - test
```

## Poetry ownership

When Poetry owns Python dependency truth, declare it under
`toolchains.python.package_managers.poetry`.

```yaml
toolchains:
  python:
    version: ">=3.12,<3.14"
    package_managers:
      poetry: ">=1.8"
```

## uv hydration

When a Python repo uses uv for dependency setup, prefer first-class dependency hydration instead of
raw `run: uv sync` or raw `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`.

```yaml
tasks:
  setup:
    description: Hydrate Python dependencies
    prepare:
      kind: dependency_hydration
      medium: package_dependencies
      source:
        kind: uv
        cwd: .
        default_index: https://pypi.org/simple
    requirements:
      toolchains:
        - python
    effects:
      writes:
        - .venv
      network: true
      network_kind: dependency_hydration
```

## Composer hydration

When a PHP repo uses Composer for dependency setup, prefer first-class dependency hydration instead
of raw `run: composer install`.

```yaml
tasks:
  setup:
    description: Hydrate PHP dependencies
    prepare:
      kind: dependency_hydration
      medium: package_dependencies
      source:
        kind: composer
        cwd: .
    requirements:
      tools:
        composer: "*"
    effects:
      writes:
        - vendor
      network: true
      network_kind: dependency_hydration
```

## uv tool bootstrap

When the task truth is making `uv` available for later contract execution, prefer first-class tool
bootstrap instead of raw `python -m pip install ... uv` shell.

```yaml
tasks:
  setup:tooling:
    description: Ensure uv is available for this contract slice
    prepare:
      kind: tool_bootstrap
      tool: uv
      source:
        kind: pip
        exe: python
    requirements:
      toolchains:
        - python
    effects:
      network: true
      network_kind: tool_bootstrap
```

## Cypress browser bootstrap

When the repo truth is `npx|pnpm|yarn|bunx cypress install`, prefer first-class tool bootstrap
instead of burying Cypress browser/bootstrap setup inside a larger verification shell.

```yaml
toolchains:
  node:
    version: "^20.20.2"
    package_managers:
      pnpm: "10.26.0"

tasks:
  setup:browsers:
    description: Install Cypress browsers through the repo package manager
    prepare:
      kind: tool_bootstrap
      tool: cypress_browsers
      source:
        kind: node_package_manager
        cwd: .
        manager: pnpm
    requirements:
      toolchains:
        - node
    effects:
      network: true
      network_kind: tool_bootstrap
```

## Live or staging integration testing

When the verification lane depends on real services, staging credentials, or seeded remote state,
keep that narrower truth explicit with `effects.network_kind: integration_test` instead of
collapsing it into generic broad network prose.

```yaml
env:
  vars:
    STAGING_API_TOKEN:
      required: false

tasks:
  test:live:
    description: Run the staging-backed integration suite
    command:
      exe: npm
      args:
        - run
        - test:live
    requirements:
      env:
        - STAGING_API_TOKEN
    effects:
      network: true
      network_kind: integration_test
      external_state:
        - cloudflare
```

## Mixed finite setup sequencing

When one repo-level `setup` lane honestly needs more than one typed finite step, use
`prepare.kind: sequence` instead of collapsing everything back into one shell script.

```yaml
toolchains:
  python:
    version: "3.12"
    package_managers:
      poetry: ">=2.3.4,<2.4.0"

tasks:
  setup:
    description: Materialize local env and bootstrap Playwright browsers
    prepare:
      kind: sequence
      steps:
        - kind: ensure_env_file
          path: .env.local
          vars:
            APP_ENV:
              value: local
        - kind: tool_bootstrap
          tool: playwright_browsers
          browsers:
            - chromium
          with_deps: true
          source:
            kind: poetry
            cwd: .
    requirements:
      toolchains:
        - python
    effects:
      writes:
        - .env.local
      network: true
      network_kind: tool_bootstrap
```

Use `prepare.kind: sequence` only when those steps are still one typed setup lane with shared
requirements and effects. If the lane is purely deterministic setup built from action primitives,
`action.kind: ensure_bundle` is still the narrower fit. If the steps need separate reuse, distinct
requirements/effects, or separate operator entrypoints, keep them as separate finite tasks wired
through `depends_on`.

## Helm chart hydration

When the repo truth is resolving Helm chart dependencies, prefer first-class dependency hydration
instead of raw `helm dependency build ...` command bodies.

```yaml
tasks:
  setup:
    description: Resolve Helm chart dependencies
    prepare:
      kind: dependency_hydration
      medium: package_dependencies
      source:
        kind: helm
        cwd: deploy/helm
    requirements:
      tools:
        helm: "*"
    effects:
      writes:
        - deploy/helm/charts
      network: true
      network_kind: dependency_hydration
```

## Standalone CLI package-manager ownership

When the repo truth is "this standalone CLI should be fulfilled through the host package manager",
keep that ownership under `tools` instead of splitting it into `native_prerequisites`.

```yaml
tools:
  helm:
    version: ">=3.8"
    platforms:
      linux:
        acquisition:
          provider: apt
          package: helm
      macos:
        acquisition:
          provider: brew
          package: helm
          source_config:
            tap_name: vendor/tap
            tap_url: https://github.com/vendor/homebrew-tap
      windows:
        acquisition:
          provider: winget
          package: Helm.Helm
```

## Java, Rust, and .NET dependency hydration

When the repo truth is standard Java, Rust, or .NET dependency setup, prefer first-class
dependency hydration instead of raw install shell.

```yaml
toolchains:
  java:
    version: "21"
  rust:
    version: "1.94.0"
  dotnet:
    version: "8.0"

tasks:
  setup:java:
    description: Hydrate Maven dependencies through the repo wrapper
    prepare:
      kind: dependency_hydration
      medium: package_dependencies
      source:
        kind: maven
        cwd: .
        wrapper: true
        mode: go_offline
        skip_tests: true
    requirements:
      toolchains:
        - java
    effects:
      writes:
        - .mvn
        - target
      network: true
      network_kind: dependency_hydration

  setup:rust:
    description: Hydrate Cargo dependencies
    prepare:
      kind: dependency_hydration
      medium: package_dependencies
      source:
        kind: cargo
        cwd: .
    requirements:
      toolchains:
        - rust
    effects:
      writes:
        - target
      network: true
      network_kind: dependency_hydration

  setup:dotnet:
    description: Hydrate .NET dependencies
    prepare:
      kind: dependency_hydration
      medium: package_dependencies
      source:
        kind: dotnet_restore
        cwd: .
        # Use this when the repository itself owns NuGet source selection.
        config_file: NuGet.Config
    requirements:
      toolchains:
        - dotnet
    effects:
      writes:
        - obj
      network: true
      network_kind: dependency_hydration
```

For an ephemeral container-backed .NET lane, attach the package cache once at the execution
context. Ota derives `NUGET_PACKAGES` from this attachment, so the typed restore and later
`--no-restore` commands share packages without committing cache state into the worktree.

After `ota up --json`, read the typed `receipt.evaluated_inputs[]` record with
`kind: hydration_provenance` for the declared-versus-resolved feed posture Ota captured before
execution. Do not reconstruct that evidence from a later `NuGet.Config` read; an unavailable
resolution only narrows replay diagnosis and cannot establish a hermetic dependency source.

```yaml
execution:
  contexts:
    dotnet:container:
      backend: container
      lifecycle: ephemeral
      container:
        image: mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:10.0.103
      attachments:
        isolated_paths:
          - .nuget/packages
```

## Compose-wrapped typed dependency hydration

When the package hydration lane truthfully runs inside a declared Compose service, keep the typed
dependency source under `prepare.source.kind: ...` and use `prepare.source.compose` only as the
service-side wrapper instead of collapsing back to `docker compose run ... npm ci` shell.

```yaml
tasks:
  setup:
    description: Hydrate app dependencies through the api Compose service
    adapter_inputs:
      compose:
        cwd: docker
        files:
          - docker/docker-compose.yml
    prepare:
      kind: dependency_hydration
      medium: package_dependencies
      source:
        kind: node_package_manager
        cwd: app
        manager: npm
        mode: ci
        compose:
          kind: run
          service: api
          workdir: /workspace
    requirements:
      tools:
        docker: "*"
    effects:
      writes:
        - app/node_modules
      network: true
      network_kind: dependency_hydration
```

Do not add fake host `requirements.toolchains.node` here just because the in-service command is
`npm ci`. In this shape the host prerequisite is the compose engine; the typed package-manager
truth still lives under `prepare.source.kind: node_package_manager`.

## Generated artifact lineage

When a generator produces source that another task consumes, declare the generated output once at
top level and make each consumer name it explicitly. Do not use broad `effects.writes` plus task
ordering alone as the only ownership story.

```yaml
artifacts:
  typescript-sdk:
    kind: generated_source
    producer: sdk:generate
    paths:
      - sdk/typescript/src/api/client.gen.ts
    inputs:
      - schema/api.graphql

tasks:
  sdk:generate:
    command:
      exe: api-generator
      args: [generate, typescript]
  sdk:verify:
    command:
      exe: npm
      args: [run, test:sdk]
    depends_on: [sdk:generate]
    requires_artifacts: [typescript-sdk]
```

Ota validates the direct producer dependency and checks the declared output paths after the
producer closure runs. Task JSON and receipts carry the named producer/consumer lineage. Presence
does not prove freshness: do not claim that an existing generated file reflects current inputs
until a later receipt-backed derivation identity is available.

For a pnpm workspace generator slice, use `prepare.source.filter` on the typed hydration source
instead of hydrating unrelated workspace packages or writing `pnpm --filter ... install` in shell.
Ota supports this selector only for `manager: pnpm` and renders it before `install`.

## Lockfile-strict npm hydration

When the repo truth is npm plus `package-lock.json`, prefer first-class dependency hydration with
`manager: npm` and `mode: ci`.

```yaml
tasks:
  setup:
    description: Install locked Node dependencies
    prepare:
      kind: dependency_hydration
      medium: package_dependencies
      source:
        kind: node_package_manager
        cwd: .
        manager: npm
        mode: ci
```

## Env ownership

Prefer first-class env ownership such as `env_files`, `ensure_env_file`, and
`adapter_inputs.overlays.compose.env_files` before baking env-file flags into task commands. Use
`env_files` when the task process itself needs the overlay. Use
`adapter_inputs.overlays.compose.env_files` when the file is compose interpolation truth for `docker
compose` or `podman compose`, including workflow-rendered dotenv artifacts. When one selected
workflow also owns generated JSON/TOML client config, prefer `env.profiles.<name>.render.files[]`
over repo-local merge scripts.

```yaml
tasks:
  setup:env:selfhost:
    description: Materialize the self-host env file when missing
    action:
      kind: copy_if_missing
      from: .env.selfhost.example
      to: .env.selfhost

  selfhost:compose:
    description: Start the self-host compose stack
    adapter_inputs:
      compose:
        env_files:
          - .env.selfhost
    launch:
      kind: command
      exe: docker
      args:
        - compose
        - up
```

## Compose and Bake adapter roots

Use `adapter_inputs.overlays.compose.cwd` or `adapter_inputs.overlays.bake.cwd` when the truthful `docker compose`,
`podman compose`, or `docker buildx bake` working directory is a repo subdirectory. That keeps
adapter-root truth in the contract instead of hiding `cd docker && ...`,
`docker compose --project-directory ...`, or `podman compose --project-directory ...` inside shell
bodies.

```yaml
tasks:
  compose:up:
    adapter_inputs:
      compose:
        cwd: docker
        files:
          - docker/docker-compose.yml
    launch:
      kind: command
      exe: docker
      args:
        - compose
        - up

workflows:
  release:
    env:
      adapter_inputs:
        bake:
          cwd: docker
          files:
            - docker/docker-bake.hcl
            - docker/docker-bake.release.hcl
    run:
      task: bake:image
```

## Deterministic env bootstrap

Use `action.kind: ensure_env_file` when one setup lane really owns one env file and ota should own
key replacement, stale-key removal, template re-derivation, or secret generation instead of shell
copy-plus-`sed` glue.

```yaml
env:
  vars:
    DATABASE_URL:
      required: true

tasks:
  setup:env:
    action:
      kind: ensure_env_file
      path: .env.local
      template: .env.example
      vars:
        APP_ENV:
          value: local
          mode: replace
        DATABASE_URL:
          from_env: DATABASE_URL
          mode: replace
        APP_SECRET:
          random:
            bytes: 24
            encoding: hex
        LEGACY_FLAG:
          mode: remove
```

## Bundled host file preparation

Use `action.kind: ensure_bundle` when one setup lane owns more than one deterministic setup
action and those steps should stay in one governed action body instead of shell orchestration.

```yaml
tasks:
  bootstrap:local:
    action:
      kind: ensure_bundle
      steps:
        - kind: ensure_container_network
          name: local-dev
        - kind: copy_if_missing
          from: .env.example
          to: .env.local
        - kind: ensure_env_file
          path: .env.local
          vars:
            APP_ENV:
              value: local
              mode: replace
        - kind: ensure_directory
          path: .cache/ota
        - kind: ensure_file
          path: .secrets/dev-token
          random:
            bytes: 24
            encoding: hex
```

## Deterministic Git checkout bootstrap

Use `action.kind: ensure_git_checkout` when one setup lane owns clone-if-missing materialization
of a sibling or vendored repo checkout and ota should own that bootstrap truth instead of shell
`git clone`, `git checkout`, or deterministic remote-wiring glue.

```yaml
tasks:
  bootstrap:deps:
    action:
      kind: ensure_bundle
      steps:
        - kind: ensure_directory
          path: vendor
        - kind: ensure_git_checkout
          path: vendor/wagtail
          source:
            git: https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail.git
            ref: main
          remotes:
            - name: upstream
              git: git@github.com:wagtail/wagtail.git
```

## Deterministic Git template bootstrap

Use `action.kind: ensure_git_template` when one setup lane owns deterministic scaffold or factory
materialization from a Git-backed template and ota should own that bootstrap truth instead of shell
`git clone`, `rm -rf .git`, and `git init` glue.

```yaml
tasks:
  scaffold:sample:
    action:
      kind: ensure_bundle
      steps:
        - kind: ensure_directory
          path: .ota-pressure

## Deterministic container network bootstrap

Use `action.kind: ensure_container_network` when one setup lane owns shared external Docker
network readiness as its own setup lane and ota should own that truth instead of shell
`docker network inspect ... || docker network create ...` glue.

```yaml
tasks:
  network:ensure:
    context: host
    action:
      kind: ensure_container_network
      name: penpot_shared
    requirements:
      tools:
        docker: "*"
```

## Deterministic Compose-managed service volume reset

Use `action.kind: reset_compose_service_volume` when one destructive local recovery lane really
owns stopping a Compose-managed service, removing one named volume, and restarting the service
instead of hiding `docker compose stop/rm` plus `docker volume rm` glue in shell.

```yaml
tasks:
  postgres:reset:
    context: host
    action:
      kind: reset_compose_service_volume
      service: postgres
      volume: app_postgres-data
      compose:
        cwd: docker
        files:
          - docker/docker-compose.yml
        project_name: app
    requirements:
      tools:
        docker: "*"
    effects:
      external_state:
        - docker
        - postgres
    safe_for_agent: false
```

## Typed systemd host-service ownership

Use `manager.kind: host` with `manager.host.kind: systemd` when the real service owner is a
systemd unit and ota should derive lifecycle and readiness instead of hiding `systemctl` glue in
shell commands.

Validate and doctor now flag direct `systemctl start`, `stop`, and `is-active` task glue when
that ownership should move onto this typed service surface.

When you want ota to author this shape directly, prefer
`ota assist declare-service --name <service> --manager host --host-unit <unit> --style systemd-active`.

```yaml
services:
  redis:
    manager:
      kind: host
      host:
        kind: systemd
        unit: redis.service
        scope: system
    readiness:
      kind: systemd_active
      interval: 2s
      retries: 5
```

## Bake adapter ownership

Use `adapter_inputs.overlays.bake.files` when one task or workflow owns the Bake file stack for
`docker buildx bake` and that truth should stay declarative instead of living in shell `-f` flags.

```yaml
tasks:
  bake:image:
    adapter_inputs:
      bake:
        files:
          - docker-bake.hcl
    command:
      exe: docker
      args:
        - buildx
        - bake
        - app

workflows:
  release:
    env:
      adapter_inputs:
        bake:
          files:
            - docker-bake.hcl
            - docker-bake.release.hcl
    run:
      task: bake:image
```

## Native Docker Compose published host-port remap

Use `runtime.listeners.<name>.project.publication.compose.service` when one native structured
Docker Compose lane owns the published host URL for one Compose service and ota should own one-run
`--host-port` remap truth without changing the workload's internal bind port.

```yaml
tasks:
  compose:native:published:
    adapter_inputs:
      compose:
        cwd: docker
        files:
          - docker/docker-compose.yml
    compose:
      kind: up
      detach: true
      services:
        - published
    runtime:
      kind: service
      listeners:
        http:
          protocol: http
          bind:
            address: 0.0.0.0
            port:
              mode: fixed
              value: 3000
          project:
            host:
              address: 127.0.0.1
              primary: true
              port:
                mode: fixed
                value: 3000
              path: /
            publication:
              compose:
                service: published
```

That contract keeps the service bind on `3000` and lets operators run
`ota run compose:native:published --host-port 4000` to remap only the published host port for one
run.

## Minimum-version governance

When a contract depends on newer Ota parser, validator, or runtime behavior, set
`metadata.ota.minimum_version` explicitly.

```yaml
metadata:
  ota:
    minimum_version: "1.6.20"
```
