# Review Checklist

Use this checklist when deciding whether a contract is merely valid or genuinely strong.

- Does a service task that declares `runtime.kind: service` use `launch.kind: command` instead of
  opaque `run`?
- If a workflow declares `proof.lifecycle`, are its selected services manager-owned with a typed
  inactive-state observer and `lifecycle.teardown_assertion: manager_inactive`, rather than copied
  start/stop shell? Does the review preserve the distinction between a local lifecycle archive and
  runtime/application/CI proof?
- Does a bounded parent task use `aggregate.tasks` instead of `run: "true"` or aggregate membership
  hidden in `depends_on`?
- Does dependency setup use `prepare.kind: dependency_hydration` when Ota owns the package-manager
  lane?
- If setup already uses typed dependency hydration, are any remaining warnings about the real
  network/write blast radius instead of old install-shell glue?
- If the task is installing a required tool rather than repo dependencies, is that modeled with
  `prepare.kind: tool_bootstrap` instead of raw shell `pip install ...` glue?
- If a verification lane depends on real services, staging credentials, or other remote-backed
  state, does it use `effects.network_kind: integration_test` plus explicit `requirements.env`
  and `effects.external_state` instead of collapsing that truth into a generic broad network lane?
- If one setup lane spans more than one typed finite setup step under shared requirements/effects,
  is that modeled with `prepare.kind: sequence` instead of a fallback shell script?
- If one setup lane is deterministic env bootstrap, does it use `action.kind: ensure_env_file`
  instead of shell copy-plus-`sed` glue?
- If one setup lane truthfully owns clone-if-missing materialization of a sibling or vendored
  repo checkout, does it use `action.kind: ensure_git_checkout` instead of shell `git clone`
  glue?
- If one setup lane truthfully owns deterministic scaffold or factory materialization from a
  Git-backed template, does it use `action.kind: ensure_git_template` instead of shell `git clone`
  plus `rm -rf .git` and `git init` glue?
- If one setup lane owns shared external Docker network readiness, does it use
  `action.kind: ensure_container_network` instead of shell `docker network inspect/create` glue?
- If one task materializes a Dockerfile-backed local image, does it use
  `action.kind: build_container_image` with explicit `file`, `context`, and `tag` instead of
  raw `docker build` glue?
- If one destructive local recovery lane owns stopping a Compose-managed service, removing one
  named volume, and restarting the service, does it use
  `action.kind: reset_compose_service_volume` instead of shell `docker compose stop/rm` plus
  `docker volume rm` glue?
- If the repo declares Ota bootstrap truth for agents or CI, does it prefer
  `agent.bootstrap.ota.source` (`version`, `git_rev`, or pressure-only `branch`) instead of
  carrying install semantics only in raw shell strings?
- If GitHub Actions already has repo-owned bootstrap truth available, does it consume that through
  `ota-run/setup@v1 source: contract` or `ota-run/action@v1 source: contract` instead of
  restating Ota version, git revision, branch, or source-install refs in workflow YAML?
- When a repository declares contract-owned CI verification truth, does its required pull-request
  check use `ota-run/action@v1` with `command: doctor`, `install: never`, and
  `fail-on-ci-drift: true` so workflow drift fails without treating unrelated Doctor warnings as
  merge blockers?
- If one setup lane is a bundle of deterministic setup actions under one owner, does it use
  `action.kind: ensure_bundle` instead of shell orchestration?
- If a setup lane was collapsed into one parent body, is that the right owner boundary, or should
  those steps stay as separate finite tasks because they have different reuse, requirements, or
  effects?
- If the repo uses uv for Python dependency setup, is that modeled with `source.kind: uv` instead
  of a raw `run: uv sync` or raw `uv pip install -r ...` body?
- If a checked-out Python package is installed through uv, does it use `mode: pip_local_project`
  with explicit `local_project.path`, editable posture, ordered extras/groups, and a declared
  lockfile when one exists rather than opaque `uv pip install` shell?
- If the repo truthfully owns creation of one repo-local Python virtualenv such as `.venv`, is
  that modeled with `action.kind: ensure_virtualenv` instead of `uv venv ...` shell glue?
- If the repo uses npm with `package-lock.json`, is setup modeled with `manager: npm` and `mode: ci`?
- If Poetry owns Python dependency truth, is it declared under
  `toolchains.python.package_managers.poetry`?
- If the repo depends on deterministic file inputs, are those checks modeled with `kind: file`
  instead of shell `test -f ...` glue, and does any sibling relative input use
  `scope: workspace` explicitly instead of pretending it is repo-local?
- If a deterministic input must be pinned before execution, does it use a canonical
  `expected_identity: sha256:...` rather than a path-only assertion or an agent-updated digest?
- If replay-input identity policy governs a task or workflow, does each rule evaluate its own
  reachable closure, do cumulative results preserve `deny > review > allow`, and do both `deny`
  and `review` refuse rather than authorize execution?
- Do missing, unreadable, or mismatched declared replay-input pins remain unconditional refusals
  regardless of `on_insufficient`, including before mutating `ota doctor --fix` work?
- Does command admission observe each task-qualified replay input once and reuse that same
  observation set for Doctor findings, policy evaluation, hard-pin validation, and receipts?
- If a generated fixture, store, or model output needs reviewable replay authority, does it use
  `artifacts.<name>.replay` with one unsafe producer, explicit promotion, and a consumer that
  cannot reach the producer through dependencies or hooks? Does it preserve an existing
  `generated_source` lineage rather than duplicate output ownership? Is `read_only` limited to an
  enforceable ephemeral container closure and `verify_unchanged` described only as post-execution
  mutation detection?
- Are env-file and env-rendering responsibilities owned by first-class env surfaces before shell
  glue?
- When tasks mutate out-of-repo systems, does `effects.external_state` use shipped canonical
  tokens like `docker`, `postgres`, `redis`, `s3`, `cloudflare`, or `kubernetes` instead of
  repo-local aliases such as `docker_compose`, `postgresql`, or `k8s`?
- When `effects.declared` is present, does every reference resolve through a typed
  `effect_definitions` entry to a canonical non-secret `resource_bindings` identity with exact
  action-specific bounds? Is declared-only truth kept outside positive assurance and agent-safe
  promotion until a typed adapter independently reconciles the application plan and source bytes?
- When `action.kind: database_schema_mutation` is used, does `action.effect` name exactly one
  matching same-task declared effect, does the migration tree have a current expected manifest
  identity, and does the contract keep the task outside `agent.safe_tasks`? On Unix, current Ota
  opens every effective-cwd and migration-root component relative to a retained repository
  descriptor without following symlinks, and binds the contract invocation origin plus
  repository-relative effective working directory into the same selected-task plan across dry-run
  and selected execution. Repo-level `ota run` and non-dry-run repo-level `ota up` perform one
  closure-wide typed preflight before
  command-scoped replay-input policy loading, agent/crossing/sandbox admission, workflow-environment
  artifact rendering, durable-log preparation, task conditions, required services, dependencies,
  or provider contact. Proof paths invoking repo-level `ota up` inherit that boundary. Dry-run and
  other read-only command diagnosis are outside that ordering claim. Do mode and OS-variant
  overlays avoid executable-body overrides that could replace the typed action? Non-Unix execution
  refuses because race-safe capture is unavailable; it must not be described as a successful
  provider mutation. If `policies.effects.typed.rules` is active, does every selector use an
  explicit `exact`, `namespace_pattern`, or `any` resource branch, retain policy-source authority
  posture, and accumulate all matches through `deny > warn > allow`? Is
  `OTA_EFFECT_POLICY_DENIED` kept distinct from provider execution, canary success, receipts,
  archives, and positive assurance? Do not describe either a typed migration plan or an
  effect-policy decision as provider execution, provider mutation, receipt, archive, or positive
  assurance.
- When `agent.effect_refusal_canaries` is declared, does each unique canonical ID bind one existing
  effect and at least one exact task/workflow lane with a mandatory reachable attachment origin?
  Does invocation use the stored ID rather than caller-supplied effect/rule truth? A pass must bind
  the exact eligible effect, attachment, realization, invocation, policy snapshot, source evidence,
  and explicit deny-rule identities with `execution_started: false`. Generic safety/readiness,
  strict fallback, missing origin, caller overrides, or policy allow/warn must remain non-passing.
- If `docker compose` or `docker buildx bake` truth lives under a repo subdirectory, is that
  adapter root modeled with `adapter_inputs.overlays.compose.cwd` or `adapter_inputs.overlays.bake.cwd` instead of
  shell `cd ... && ...` or `docker compose --project-directory ...` glue?
- If the repo uses `docker buildx bake`, is Bake file selection owned by
  `adapter_inputs.overlays.bake.files` instead of shell `-f` / `--file` flags?
- If the repo uses Helm render/install/lint lanes, is chart root, values-file selection, release
  naming, or namespace truth owned by `adapter_inputs.overlays.helm.*` instead of shell `cd ... && helm ...`,
  chart positionals, or `--namespace` flags?
- Does agent safety account for the full selected dependency closure, not only a top-level
  `safe_for_agent` label? When CI needs to prove runner enforcement, are declared
  `agent.refusal_canaries` exercised through `--agent --expect-refusal` rather than a shell test?
- If the contract declares authoritative `runtime_boundary` controls, does agent execution resolve
  one compatible enforcing target or refuse before setup instead of silently publishing advisory
  posture?
- If `oci_local` is selected, is the task already an explicit-platform ephemeral container lane,
  are writable carve-outs present and alias-safe, and are targeted egress, inherited service
  networks, image-declared volumes, undeclared mounts, runtime-control sockets, and unsupported path
  controls refused rather than weakened?
- Is `container.platform` a supported Linux OCI target and treated as the execution target for
  variants, inputs, environment, requirements, and ordinary/provider-enforced execution-backend
  container creation, with persistent reuse invalidated when the pin changes?
- Is the selected closure limited to finite command bodies, with no requirements, services,
  conditional checks, typed task bodies, or lifecycle-proof work executing before an evidenced
  provider boundary?
- Does dry-run admission agree with real execution, and does the receipt carry runner-authored
  initial/terminal application plus confirmed cleanup evidence archived against the exact contract
  and identified policy-authority snapshots? Is the claim still bounded to the selected Ota
  execution lane?
- Does every enforced phase use a distinct task identity, rather than reusing one task as both a
  dependency and hook and collapsing separate invocations into one evidence segment?
- Does every contract declare `metadata.ota.minimum_version` at the lowest honest compatible
  release, including published examples?
- When a contract declares a released `agent.bootstrap.ota.source.version`, is it greater than or
  equal to `metadata.ota.minimum_version`?
- Do public CI or proof workflows consume that checked release through `ota-run/setup@v1` or
  `ota-run/action@v1` with `source: contract`, rather than independently selecting an older Ota
  build?
