# Execution Governance Capability Map

Use this map when authoring or reviewing an Ota contract that needs more than basic task execution.
Open the focused public reference before copying the example.

| Job | Public reference | Contract or evidence surface | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Restrict agent execution to an effective safe closure | [Safe Agent Execution and Refusal](https://ota.run/docs/reference/safe-agent-execution-and-refusal) | `agent.safe_tasks`, `safe_for_agent`, `agent.refusal_canaries`, `ota run|up --agent` | [`reference/safe-agent-execution`](https://github.com/ota-run/examples/tree/1.6.26-implementation/reference/safe-agent-execution) |
| Project contract-owned verification into CI | [Contract-to-CI Governance](https://ota.run/docs/reference/contract-to-ci-governance) | `ota ci projection`, `ota ci github render|check|sync`, stable merge-check identity | [`ci/github-actions`](https://github.com/ota-run/examples/tree/main/ci/github-actions) |
| Apply compatible runtime controls through a provider | [Sandbox Policy and Runtime Enforcement](https://ota.run/docs/reference/sandbox-policy-and-runtime-enforcement) | selected closure policy, target platform, `--sandbox-target oci_local`, applied-control and cleanup evidence | [`reference/enforced-oci-sandbox`](https://github.com/ota-run/examples/tree/1.6.26-implementation/reference/enforced-oci-sandbox) |
| Publish bounded proof rather than one broad green | [Proof Evidence and Honest Boundaries](https://ota.run/docs/reference/proof-evidence-and-honest-boundaries) | `proof_verdict`, `not_proved[]`, dependency evidence, prerequisite freshness, lifecycle proof | [`reference/runtime-proof-evidence`](https://github.com/ota-run/examples/tree/main/reference/runtime-proof-evidence) |
| Govern immutable replay inputs and generated baselines | [Replay Inputs and Trusted Baselines](https://ota.run/docs/reference/replay-inputs-and-trusted-baselines) | `replay_inputs[]`, `expected_identity`, replay policy, artifact record/promotion/consumption | [`reference/replay-baseline-regeneration`](https://github.com/ota-run/examples/tree/main/reference/replay-baseline-regeneration) |
| Check whether evidence supports a contract claim | [Contract-Claim Assurance](https://ota.run/docs/reference/contract-claim-assurance) | `claim_assurance[]` with `supported`, `contradicted`, or `unknown` | Use selected proof and archived receipt evidence; never author the outcome directly |
| Audit a heavier allowed boundary crossing | [Audited Execution Boundary Crossings](https://ota.run/docs/reference/audited-execution-boundary-crossings) | released crossing classification/records; active V11.7 signed grant preview | [`reference/audited-crossing-authority`](https://github.com/ota-run/examples/tree/1.6.26-implementation/reference/audited-crossing-authority) |
| Explain semantic contract drift against failures | [Semantic Snapshots and Correlation](https://ota.run/docs/reference/semantic-snapshots-and-correlation) | archived contract snapshot, `ota diff`, receipt baseline correlation | [`reference/receipt-workflow-history`](https://github.com/ota-run/examples/tree/main/reference/receipt-workflow-history) |

## Authoring rules

- Do not add a field because the feature name sounds useful. Model only a selected repo behavior
  that Ota can validate, execute, or bound honestly.
- Keep declaration, admission, execution, proof, and authority separate.
- A safe task label must be true for its complete closure.
- A provider capability profile is not enforcement until the provider applies it and Ota records
  bounded applied-control evidence.
- A green proof must carry its `not_proved[]` boundary.
- A baseline record is not trusted until one exact attestation is explicitly promoted.
- Claim assurance is derived evidence posture; never hand-author `supported`.
- A crossing record is never reusable approval authority.
- The V11.7 `--grant` carrier remains unreleased and incomplete. Do not teach repository-owned trust
  keys or signed bundles as a shortcut.
- Raw shell outside an adopted Ota, CI, or sandbox chokepoint remains outside Ota's control.
