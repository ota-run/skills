# Agent And Governance Checklist

Use this checklist when deciding whether a contract is trustworthy for humans, CI, and agents.

- Does `agent.entrypoint` lead into the canonical verification or readiness path?
- Is `agent.default_task` finite, bounded, and suitable as the normal post-change verification task?
- Are `agent.safe_tasks` honest about network and dependency hydration behavior rather than marking
  long-running or broad-mutation tasks safe?
- Does `verify_after_changes` point to the real bounded verification surface?
- Do `writable_paths` and `protected_paths` match the effects of safe tasks, generated files, and
  dependency hydration?
- If `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` exists, is it the right kind of source for the job:
  Ota-generated guidance should stay self-origin and excluded from detect evidence, prose-only
  docs should not be over-interpreted, and only structured external boundary lists should be
  treated as admissible detect truth?
- Are task `effects` explicit when the task writes, touches external state, or uses the network?
- Are blocker `checks` present when the repo has known preconditions that should fail early in
  `ota doctor`?
- Do runtime-proof workflows prove surfaced readiness rather than only process startup?
- If the contract uses newer surfaces, do workflow pins and `metadata.ota.minimum_version` stay in
  sync?
