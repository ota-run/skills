# Agent And Governance Checklist

Use this checklist when deciding whether a contract is trustworthy for humans, CI, and agents.

- Does `agent.entrypoint` lead into the canonical verification or readiness path?
- Is `agent.default_task` finite, bounded, and suitable as the normal post-change verification task?
- Are `agent.safe_tasks` honest about network and dependency hydration behavior rather than marking
  long-running or broad-mutation tasks safe?
- Does `agent.notes` tell humans and agents to discover the bounded surface with
  `ota tasks --safe --use`, that only callable lanes may use `ota run --agent <task>`, and that
  no agent may drop `--agent`, invoke a raw repository command, or treat another system's `ALLOW`
  as Ota authority? A contract with no safe lanes should say so plainly and omit agent defaults
  rather than naming an unsafe `entrypoint`, `default_task`, or `verify_after_changes` lane.
- Is each claimed-safe task safe across its full selected dependency and aggregate closure, not
  only at the requested task body?
- When a repo needs to prove the runner still refuses a disallowed lane, does it declare
  `agent.refusal_canaries` and run each control through `ota run --agent --expect-refusal` or
  `ota up --agent --workflow <name> --expect-refusal`? A shell imitation does not test Ota's
  enforcement boundary.
- Does `verify_after_changes` point to the real bounded verification surface?
- Do `writable_paths` and `protected_paths` match the effects of safe tasks, generated files, and
  dependency hydration?
- If `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` exists, is it the right kind of source for the job:
  Ota-generated guidance should stay self-origin and excluded from detect evidence, prose-only
  docs should not be over-interpreted, and only structured external boundary lists plus narrow
  command surfaces such as labeled command bullets or exact `| Task | Command |` tables inside
  explicit command sections should be treated as admissible detect truth?
- Are task `effects` explicit when the task writes, touches external state, or uses the network?
- Do task or workflow `notes` preserve material operational context that the field structure alone
  cannot carry, including hydration provenance, external-effect boundaries, proof limits, and why a
  task remains non-agent-safe? Keep notes specific; do not add boilerplate to simple finite tasks.
- Are blocker `checks` present when the repo has known preconditions that should fail early in
  `ota doctor`?
- If selected immutable replay inputs must not drift, do they declare `expected_identity` and keep
  the pin maintainer-reviewed rather than allowing Ota or an agent to rewrite it?
- If replay-input identity policy governs selected tasks or workflows, do task rules own their
  reachable closures, do rules accumulate deterministically with `deny > review > allow`, and do
  `review`, unavailable policy, and hard-pin failures all refuse before execution or mutation?
- Are policy findings and admission-produced receipts derived from one command-scoped replay-input
  observation set rather than rereading mutable files or reconstructing policy after execution?
- If `governance.crossing_authority` is present, does the repository contain only the authority
  identity while keys, bundles, sequence state, and trust paths remain independently managed
  system state? Repository-controlled trust material is self-issued authority.
- Does every heavier non-agent grant bind the exact semantic closure and remain subject to
  freshness, revocation, and rollback checks? A grant must never widen `--agent` safety or be
  accepted for a routine lane.
- Does every real granted crossing carry a terminal runner-owned transaction created before
  selected-lane mutation, while refusal and dry-run remain admission-only and create no
  transaction or crossing record?
- Does refused admission preserve typed authority-source, authority/grant selection, stable reason,
  and `execution_started: false` evidence without minting a crossing record?
- Is the local transaction posture described honestly as
  `runner_local_content_addressed`, without implying independent authentication against same-user
  writes to `.ota/state`?
- Does the first signed-file carrier avoid free-form task inputs and stay described as bounded
  offline authority with a bounded local transaction carrier rather than human identity proof,
  online revocation, or independently authenticated one-use work-unit authority?
- If the contract consumes a promoted generated baseline, does it state the honest authority and
  execution boundary: explicit `replay_baseline` promotion, SCM review as an external trust
  assumption rather than Ota-verified approval, and `read_only` only where an ephemeral container
  can enforce it?
- Do runtime-proof workflows prove surfaced readiness rather than only process startup?
- If a workflow declares `proof.lifecycle`, does it use only manager-owned services with positive
  inactive-state cleanup authority, preserve pre-existing/unknown-state services, and retain
  lifecycle `not_proved[]` boundaries instead of treating command success as application proof?
- Is lifecycle proof intentionally outside CI projection and claim assurance until a separately
  eligible typed or isolated boundary has been pressure-proven?
- Do all contracts, including published examples, declare `metadata.ota.minimum_version`, and do
  workflow pins stay in sync with that lowest honest compatible release?
