# Ota

Use this skill when the task is about Ota-specific contract authoring, review, readiness
modeling, or Ota platform judgment.

Do not use this skill for generic YAML generation. It is for truthful repo readiness
modeling, not schema-only completion.

## Core product posture

- Doctor first, contract second.
- `ota.yaml` is the canonical source of repo readiness truth.
- Prefer one explicit operational path over parallel scripts and tribal knowledge.
- If the repo needs ugly glue because Ota lacks a product feature, call it out as an Ota
  gap instead of normalizing the workaround.

## Source priority

Prefer sources in this order:

1. the repo you are actively working on
2. local canonical Ota references, when they exist in the checkout:
   - `ota.yaml`
   - `examples/`
   - `docs/spec/contract-reference.md`
   - `docs/spec/json-output-reference.md`
   - `README.md`
3. public references in `references/official-sources.md`

Do not jump straight to public docs if the local repository already contains the canonical
answer. If the active repo is not the Ota repo, treat local repo files as evidence about that
project, not as Ota product documentation.

## Bootstrap flow

Always prefer using the real Ota binary when it is available.

1. Check whether `ota` exists.
2. If it is missing, ask for approval before installing it.
3. Use the official install commands only:
   - macOS / Linux:
     - `curl -fsSL https://dist.ota.run/install.sh | sh`
   - Windows PowerShell:
     - `irm https://dist.ota.run/install.ps1 | iex`
4. After install, use real Ota commands instead of hand-wavy advice.

Prefer the official install docs and repository references in
`references/official-sources.md` when you need canonical links.

Do not silently install Ota, install agent skills, modify shell profiles, or overwrite an existing
`ota.yaml`. Ask first unless the user explicitly requested that action.

## Canonical command workflow

Use the smallest real Ota workflow that fits the task:

- `ota doctor`
  - inspect readiness blockers, warnings, next actions, and agent guidance
- `ota init`
  - create a starter contract only when the user wants Ota adoption or no contract exists
- `ota detect`
  - inspect deterministic repo evidence before broadening a contract
- `ota validate`
  - verify structural and semantic contract correctness
- `ota tasks`
  - discover named task surfaces
- `ota run <task>`
  - execute canonical task flows
- `ota up`
  - prepare the repo into a ready state

If a contract already exists, start with `ota doctor` and `ota validate` before editing it.

If the repository has no contract yet:

1. inspect the smallest real operational surface
2. model the minimum truthful contract
3. validate it
4. only then broaden the contract if real repo truth requires it

For agent, Studio, CI, or other integration surfaces, prefer Ota JSON output (`--json`) or documented
schemas. Do not parse rich human output unless no machine-readable surface exists, and call that out
as an Ota platform gap.

## Contract authoring workflow

When creating or refining a contract:

1. Identify the real operational truth with the minimum repo reading needed:
   - setup path
   - runtime dependencies
   - env sources and required vars
   - service and readiness ownership
   - canonical tasks
   - agent-safe boundaries
2. Model only what is actually true today.
3. Keep the contract minimal but complete enough that:
   - `ota doctor` is useful
   - `ota up` has a clear path
   - `ota run` executes named tasks honestly
4. Prefer contract fields over repo-local helper scripts when Ota already supports the
   behavior cleanly.

Before editing:

- preserve existing user intent in `ota.yaml`
- make the narrowest complete contract change
- update docs/tests only when command behavior, schema shape, or published examples change
- validate with `ota validate` and, when useful, `ota doctor`

Author from evidence, not vibes. Before writing or broadening a contract, inspect the smallest
set of repo files that reveal real behavior:

- package/build manifests (`package.json`, workspace files, lockfiles, language manifests)
- contributor docs (`README`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `DEVELOPERS`, setup docs)
- CI workflows that show canonical install, build, test, and smoke paths
- compose/container files only when the workflow actually needs services or containers
- existing scripts that users already run successfully

Keep scope honest. If the contract only models one slice of a large repo, say that in
`project.description`, workflow descriptions, and the final response. Do not make a partial
contract sound like full production readiness.

Default modeling areas:

- `project`
- `execution.contexts`
- `toolchains`, `runtimes`, and `tools`
- `env.sources` and `env.vars`
- `services` and readiness
- `tasks`
- `workflows`
- `checks`
- `agent`

When deciding where something belongs, prefer:

- `toolchains` for managed ecosystem ownership such as Node/Corepack/pnpm or Rust/rustup
- `runtimes` for direct runtime presence/version checks not owned by a toolchain
- `tools` for standalone command checks not owned by a toolchain
- `env` for runtime config truth
- `services` for declared managed services and readiness ownership
- `checks` for operator-facing blockers and warnings
- `tasks` for named execution paths
- `workflows` for canonical user-facing paths through prepare/setup/run/readiness
- `agent` for safety and automation boundaries

Do not duplicate ownership across `toolchains`, `runtimes`, and `tools`. If a package manager,
runtime, or command is owned by a declared toolchain, task requirements may select it, but top-level
runtime/tool ownership should not be duplicated.

## Production-readiness gates

When the user asks whether an Ota contract is solid, production-ready, PR-ready, or suitable for a
serious OSS repo, evaluate these gates explicitly:

- Scope honesty: the contract description and workflow names match the repo slice actually modeled.
- Deterministic setup: CI/proof install paths use lockfile-respecting commands where the repo
  supports them.
- Bounded agent defaults: `agent.default_task`, `agent.safe_tasks`, and `verify_after_changes`
  prefer finite verification tasks over long-running dev loops.
- Readiness truth: surfaces/checks prove the declared workflow is usable, not just that a process
  started.
- Workflow fidelity: Ota workflows mirror real contributor/CI paths instead of inventing a parallel
  path.
- Agent boundary: writable/protected paths are tight, and generated-file exceptions do not conflict
  with protected paths.
- CI proof posture: public PR workflows use released Ota setup/install paths unless the task is
  explicitly pressure-testing unreleased Ota.
- Container/native parity: container and native workflows are both modeled only when the repo
  actually supports them, and lifecycle choices are intentional.
- Ota gap honesty: missing provider/features are called out as Ota gaps instead of hidden in
  scripts.

If one of these gates fails, call it out directly before saying the contract is production-ready.

## Contract review workflow

When reviewing an `ota.yaml`, look for:

- fake readiness
- duplicated truth between tasks, scripts, and contract
- weak or missing blocker checks
- unclear `ota up` path
- over-modeled speculative surfaces
- agent writable/protected paths that are too loose
- tasks that depend on hidden local state
- readiness that only proves a process started, not that the repo is truly ready
- long-running dev tasks marked agent-safe or used as the default agent task
- install/setup commands that ignore the repo lockfile or canonical package manager
- weak dependency checks such as checking only that `node_modules` exists
- public CI workflows pinned to unreleased Ota branches or local source installs
- protected paths that contradict generated safe setup actions
- workflow names/descriptions that overclaim the modeled slice
- missing bounded verification tasks for the repo's known preflight checks
- duplicated ownership across toolchains, runtimes, and tools

A good review should separate:

- repo contract issue
- repo implementation issue
- Ota platform gap

A good review response should usually end with:

- the top contract issues
- any Ota gaps
- the next best change

When reviewing, lead with findings in priority order and include concrete file/line references when
available. State whether validation was run. If it was not run, say why. Then summarize what is
solid, what is missing, what to add, and what to remove.

## Ota gap detection

If the strongest solution is blocked by Ota itself:

- say that explicitly
- identify the missing Ota capability precisely
- prefer the product fix over a repo-local workaround when feasible

Do not normalize:

- shell retry hacks
- duplicated config
- UI surfaces that bypass Ota truth
- local glue used only to route around an Ota defect

## Studio guidance

When the task touches Ota Studio:

- keep one UI system
- keep local and cloud behind adapters
- keep `ota` canonical
- keep the UI consuming shaped Ota data, not terminal scraping
- keep `ota.yaml` and Ota JSON output as the data contract boundary

Prefer:

- local mode through `ota studio`
- cloud mode through private backend adapters
- shared view models above both

## Anti-patterns to reject

- giant autogenerated contracts with low trust
- YAML that is valid but not operationally honest
- task surfaces that duplicate existing Ota semantics
- “just put it in a script” when a contract field already exists
- making users carry platform defects in repo-local glue
- overfitting the contract to one temporary workflow
- parsing human CLI output when JSON/schema output exists
- broadening agent permissions to make a weak contract pass

## References

Read `references/official-sources.md` when you need canonical install links, official docs,
or public GitHub references for examples and contract behavior.

## Expected output style

When the task is analytical rather than editing, keep the response high-signal and concrete.

Prefer:

- what is modeled well
- what is weak or missing
- whether the issue belongs in the repo or in Ota
- the narrowest correct next step

Do not produce generic YAML commentary, long tutorials, or broad best-practice lists that are
not tied to the actual repo.
